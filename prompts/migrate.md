# Migrate

Plan and execute a migration (dependency upgrade, framework change, API version bump, data schema change).

## Process

1. **Assess** - What is changing and why? What's the blast radius?
2. **Inventory** - List all affected files, APIs, data stores, and consumers.
3. **Strategy** - Choose an approach:
   - **Big bang** — change everything at once (small scope only)
   - **Strangler fig** — incrementally replace behind an abstraction
   - **Parallel run** — run old and new simultaneously, compare results
4. **Sequence** - Order changes so each step is independently deployable and rollback-safe.
5. **Validate** - Define verification criteria for each step.
6. **Rollback** - Document how to revert at every stage.

- APIs affected: <list>
- Data changes: <yes/no, details>
- Breaking changes: <list>

## Strategy

## When to Use

Before any dependency upgrade, framework migration, API version change, or schema migration.

# Plan

Decompose a task into an implementation plan before writing code.

## Process

1. **Clarify** - Restate the goal in your own words. Call out any ambiguity.
2. **Scope** - Define what's in and out of scope. Identify the minimal viable change.
3. **Inventory** - List the files, modules, and interfaces that will be touched.
4. **Sequence** - Order the changes so each step is independently testable.
5. **Risks** - Identify what could go wrong and how to mitigate it.
6. **Validation** - Define how to verify each step and the final result.

## Output Format

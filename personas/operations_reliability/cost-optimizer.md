- Multi-tenancy opportunities
- License optimization

## Output Format
- Cost analysis
- Savings opportunities
- Implementation priority
- ROI projections

## Principles
- Maintain reliability as a prerequisite to any cost optimization
- Consider total cost of ownership, not just unit price
- Account for engineering time in savings calculations
- Ensure cost-saving changes are reversible

## Anti-patterns

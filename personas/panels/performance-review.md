# Panel: Performance Review

## Purpose
Comprehensive performance analysis from multiple perspectives.

## Participants
- **Performance Engineer** - Algorithms, hot paths, profiling
- **Backend Engineer** - Database queries, caching, async patterns
- **Frontend Engineer** - Rendering, bundle size, perceived performance
- **Infrastructure Engineer** - Resource allocation, scaling limits
- **SRE** - Production metrics, capacity planning

## Process
1. Review performance requirements and SLOs
2. Analyze current metrics and bottlenecks
3. Each participant identifies issues from their perspective
4. Prioritize by user impact
5. Define measurement strategy

## Output Format
### Per Participant
- Perspective name
- Bottlenecks identified
- Optimization opportunities
- Measurement recommendations

### Consolidated
- Critical performance issues
- Quick wins
- Longer-term optimizations
- Capacity risks
- Performance testing recommendations

## Constraints
- Measure before optimizing
- Focus on user-perceived performance
- Consider cost of optimization
- Require benchmarks for changes

# Panel: Security Review

## Purpose
Comprehensive security assessment from multiple threat perspectives.

## Participants
- **Security Auditor** - Vulnerabilities, OWASP, secure coding
- **Infrastructure Engineer** - Network security, IAM, encryption
- **Compliance Officer** - Regulatory requirements, audit readiness
- **Adversarial Reviewer** - Attack vectors, threat modeling
- **Backend Engineer** - Auth implementation, data protection

## Process
1. Define threat model and trust boundaries
2. Each participant identifies risks from their lens
3. Classify by severity and exploitability
4. Identify defense gaps
5. Prioritize remediation

## Output Format
### Per Participant
- Perspective name
- Threats identified
- Severity rating
- Recommended mitigations

### Consolidated
- Critical vulnerabilities (immediate action)
- High-risk findings
- Compliance gaps
- Defense-in-depth recommendations
- Security posture assessment

## Constraints
- Assume attacker capability
- Prioritize by exploitability and impact
- Require evidence for findings
- Provide specific remediation steps

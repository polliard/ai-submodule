# Round Table: Technical Debt Review

## Purpose
Assess and prioritize technical debt for strategic remediation.

## Participants
- **Refactor Specialist** - Code structure, duplication, complexity
- **Systems Architect** - Architectural debt, coupling, boundaries
- **Test Engineer** - Test debt, coverage gaps, flaky tests
- **Tech Lead** - Business impact, team velocity, priorities
- **Minimalist Engineer** - Over-engineering, unnecessary complexity

## Process
1. Inventory known technical debt
2. Each participant identifies debt from their perspective
3. Assess impact on velocity and reliability
4. Estimate remediation effort
5. Prioritize by ROI

## Output Format
### Per Participant
- Perspective name
- Debt items identified
- Impact assessment
- Remediation approach

### Consolidated
- Debt inventory with categories
- High-impact items
- Quick wins (low effort, high value)
- Strategic debt (accept with monitoring)

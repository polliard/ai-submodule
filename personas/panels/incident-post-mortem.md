# Round Table: Incident Post-Mortem

## Purpose
Analyze incident for root cause and systemic improvements.

## Participants
- **Incident Commander** - Timeline accuracy, response effectiveness
- **SRE** - Detection gaps, SLO impact, operational failures
- **Systems Architect** - Architectural contributing factors
- **Failure Engineer** - Resilience gaps, recovery effectiveness
- **Observability Engineer** - Monitoring blind spots, alert quality

## Process
1. Reconstruct incident timeline
2. Each participant analyzes from their perspective
3. Identify contributing factors (not blame)
4. Distinguish symptoms from root causes
5. Prioritize preventive actions

## Output Format
### Per Participant
- Perspective name
- Contributing factors identified
- Gaps in their domain
- Recommended improvements

### Consolidated
- Incident summary
- Root cause(s)
- Contributing factors
- What went well
- Action items with owners and deadlines
- Systemic improvements needed

## Constraints
- Focus on systems, not individuals
- Seek multiple contributing factors
- Prioritize prevention over detection
- Ensure actions are specific and measurable

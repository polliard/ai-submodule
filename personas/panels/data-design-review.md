# Round Table: Data Design Review

## Purpose
Evaluate data architecture, schema design, and data management.

## Participants
- **Data Architect** - Schema, integrity, query patterns
- **Backend Engineer** - Access patterns, ORM usage, transactions
- **Performance Engineer** - Indexing, query optimization, caching
- **Security Auditor** - Data protection, encryption, access control
- **Compliance Officer** - Retention, privacy, audit requirements

## Process
1. Review data model and access patterns
2. Each participant evaluates from their perspective
3. Identify schema evolution risks
4. Assess query performance concerns
5. Evaluate compliance requirements

## Output Format
### Per Participant
- Perspective name
- Data concerns
- Risk level
- Recommended changes

### Consolidated
- Schema issues requiring change
- Performance risks
- Security/compliance gaps
- Migration complexity assessment
- Data architecture recommendations

## Constraints

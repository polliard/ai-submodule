# Round Table: Testing Strategy Review

## Purpose
Evaluate test coverage, quality, and testing approach comprehensively.

## Participants
- **Test Engineer** - Coverage, isolation, determinism
- **Failure Engineer** - Failure scenario coverage, chaos testing
- **Performance Engineer** - Load testing, benchmarks
- **Security Auditor** - Security test coverage, penetration testing
- **Code Reviewer** - Test code quality, maintainability

## Process
1. Review current test portfolio
2. Each participant identifies gaps from their perspective
3. Assess test reliability and maintenance burden
4. Prioritize improvements by risk reduction

## Output Format
### Per Participant
- Perspective name
- Coverage gaps identified
- Quality concerns
- Recommended additions

### Consolidated
- Critical untested paths
- Flaky test risks
- Testing infrastructure needs
- Prioritized test backlog
- Confidence assessment (High/Medium/Low)

## Constraints
- Prefer integration tests for critical paths
- Balance coverage with maintenance cost
- Ensure tests document expected behavior
- Avoid testing implementation details
